# a =int(input("enter a value for the frst number="))
# b = int(input("enter a value for the second number="))

# b,a = a, b

# print("after swiping")
# print("value of the first number",a)
# print("value of the second number",b)

# 2nd example---------------
# str= "yellow", 20, "red"
# a,b,c = str
# print(a)

# 3rd example---choose the corect way to access value 20 from the folowing tuple---------
# tup = ("orange", [10,20,30],(5,15,25))
# print(tup[1][1])


# 4th question 
# tup1 = (2,4,3)
# tup2 = tup1 * 2
# print(tup2)

# 5th question
# tup1 =("annie", "hena","sid")
# print(tup1[-3:0])

# 6th question------which of the following question will not reslt in an error when performed on tuples in python where
#  tuple1 = (5,2,7,0,3)?
# a) tuple1[1]=2
# b) tuple1.append(2)
# c) tuple1 =tuple1 + tuple1
# d) tuple1.sort()


#question 7 
# dict = {"phy":94, "chem":85,"bio":97,"maths":66}
# dict.update({"chem":98, "maths":100})
# print(dict)

# question 8 copy dictionary in python
# dict = {"phy":94, "chem":85,"bio":97,"maths":66}
# dict2 = dict.copy()
# print(dict2)
# dict2 = dict
# print(dict2)
